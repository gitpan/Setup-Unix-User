NAME
    Setup::Unix::User - Setup Unix user (existence, group memberships)

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use Setup::Unix::User 'setup_unix_user';

     # simple usage (doesn't save undo data)
     my $res = setup_unix_user name => 'foo',
                               member_of => ['admin', 'wheel'];
     die unless $res->[0] == 200 || $res->[0] == 304;

     # perform setup and save undo data (undo data should be serializable)
     $res = setup_unix_user ..., -undo_action => 'do';
     die unless $res->[0] == 200 || $res->[0] == 304;
     my $undo_data = $res->[3]{undo_data};

     # perform undo
     $res = setup_unix_user ..., -undo_action => "undo", -undo_data=>$undo_data;
     die unless $res->[0] == 200 || $res->[0] == 304;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides one function: setup_unix_user.

    This module is part of the Setup modules family.

    This module uses Log::Any logging framework.

    This module's functions have Sub::Spec specs.

THE SETUP MODULES FAMILY
    I use the "Setup::" namespace for the Setup modules family. See
    Setup::File for more details on the goals, characteristics, and
    implementation of Setup modules family.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  setup_unix_user(%args) -> [STATUS_CODE, ERR_MSG, RESULT]
    Setup Unix user (existence, group memberships).

    On do, will create Unix user if not already exists. And also make sure
    user belong to specified groups (and not belong to unwanted groups).

    On undo, will delete Unix user (along with its initially created home
    dir and files) if it was created by this function. Also will restore old
    group memberships.

    Returns a 3-element arrayref. STATUS_CODE is 200 on success, or an error
    code between 3xx-5xx (just like in HTTP). ERR_MSG is a string containing
    error message, RESULT is the actual result.

    This function supports undo operation. See Sub::Spec::Clause::features
    for details on how to perform do/undo/redo.

    This function supports dry-run (simulation) mode. To run in dry-run
    mode, add argument "-dry_run" => 1.

    Arguments ("*" denotes required arguments):

    *   create_home_dir => *bool* (default 1)

        Whether to create homedir when creating new user.

    *   max_new_gid => *str*

        Set maximum GID when creating new group.

        Default follows max_new_uid

    *   max_new_uid => *str* (default 65534)

        Set maximum UID when creating new user.

    *   member_of => *array*

        List of Unix group names that the user must be member of.

        The first element will be used as the primary group. If a group
        doesn't exist, it will be ignored.

        If not specified, the default is one group having the same name as
        the user. The group will be created if not already exists.

    *   min_new_gid => *str*

        Set minimum GID when creating new group.

        Default is UID

    *   min_new_uid => *str* (default 0)

        Set minimum UID when creating new user.

    *   name* => *str*

        User name.

    *   new_gecos => *str* (default "")

        Set gecos (usually, full name) when creating new user.

    *   new_home_dir => *str*

        Set home directory when creating new user, defaults to
        /home/<username>.

    *   new_home_dir_mode => *int* (default 448)

        Set permission mode of home dir when creating new user.

    *   new_password => *str*

        Set password when creating new user.

        Default is a random password

    *   new_shell => *str* (default "/bin/bash")

        Set shell when creating new user.

    *   not_member_of* => *str*

        List of Unix group names that the user must NOT be member of.

    *   should_already_exist => *bool* (default 0)

        If set to true, require that user already exists.

        This can be used to fix user membership, but does not create user
        when it doesn't exist.

    *   skel_dir => *str* (default "/etc/skel")

        Directory to get skeleton files when creating new user.

    *   use_skel_dir => *bool* (default 1)

        Whether to copy files from skeleton dir when creating new user.
